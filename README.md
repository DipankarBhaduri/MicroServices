# Microservices Project

Welcome to the Microservices project! This project showcases a simple implementation of a system based on the Microservices architecture.

## Overview

Microservices architecture is an approach to building software systems by breaking down a monolithic application into small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with others through APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices-project.git
    cd microservices-project
    ```

2. **Setup Microservices**: 
    - Navigate to each microservice directory.
    - Follow the README in each directory for setup instructions.

3. **Run the Application**: 
    - Start each microservice individually.
    - Ensure they can communicate with each other.

## Microservices

### User Service

- Manages user-related operations.

### Order Service

- Handles order processing and management.

## API Documentation

- Documented APIs for each microservice.
- Sample requests and responses.

## Technologies Used

- List of technologies, frameworks, and tools.

## Conclusion

Thank you for exploring the Microservices project! This example illustrates the basics of Microservices architecture and provides a starting point for understanding how independent services can work together.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
